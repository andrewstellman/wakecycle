# Wakecycle — Requirements Document

*Status: v1.1 (2026-06-13). v1.0 consolidated the founding contract from the v1.5.9 harness design arc (design docs, capability-ladder decisions, multi-host research, edge-case register, empirical validation runs). v1.1 adds the **v0.1.0 first-release UX scope** locked 2026-06-13: canonical versioning (FR-34), the control-file convention (FR-35..39), the flexible-input adapter (FR-40/41), job-config UX (FR-42..44), the SUMMARY roll-up (FR-45), in-context worker mode (FR-46..49 / UC-9), and unattended-reliability positioning (FR-50). The FR/NFR numbering is the stable reference for tests and docs.*

*Sources of record: the v1.5.9 design + multi-host research notes and the validation-run records from which this was consolidated.*

## 1. Overview

The harness is a batch orchestrator for AI coding agents that runs **inside the operator's existing agent session** — or, degraded gracefully, inside a plain terminal window — with no server, no daemon, no framework, no API keys beyond the session the operator already has, and no admin rights. It is deliberately **agent-agnostic**: it orchestrates *any* agentic coding system (Claude Code, Copilot, Codex, Cursor, Antigravity, …) rather than one vendor, because the engine is stdlib Python and the worker contract is vendor-neutral (FR-54). The primary way an operator uses it is conversational — describe a run in plain language to the agent that has the skill loaded, and it assembles, previews, runs, and saves the session (FR-52).

Its architecture inverts the usual orchestration-framework shape. Frameworks put the intelligence in external infrastructure and treat the model as a worker. The harness puts **all the determinism in a small stdlib Python script** (the tick engine: a disk-truth state machine advanced one idempotent tick at a time) and uses the agent only as a relay that can wake on a schedule and start workers. The agent never decides anything; the script is the state machine; disk is the database; crash-recovery is "run one tick."

A **plan** (JSON) lists jobs — each an opaque worker prompt plus a target — with a pool size and tick cadence. Workers report progress by appending heartbeat lines to a known file. Each tick: read disk, reap finished workers, dispatch queued jobs into free pool slots, detect stalls, print a status table, schedule the next tick. When everything is terminal, the loop ends itself.

**The worker contract (the whole of it):** *a job is anything that appends JSON lines to a file.* A line at start, a line every so often, a terminal line at the end — single-line JSON, one writer per file. The `status` enum is the only field the harness interprets; everything else is decoration it displays but never reads. The worker doesn't have to be an AI: a shell script, a make target, a CI job, or a human with `echo >>` all qualify; the heartbeat helper is a convenience SDK, not a requirement. The contract deliberately honors **Postel's law** — *be conservative in what the harness emits, liberal in what it accepts*: a worker that never writes, dies mid-run, or writes garbage degrades to a visible STALLED/failed row in the status table, never to a wedged state machine, and a malformed line is skipped (and warned about), never fatal. Heartbeats are how a worker earns "running" and "completed"; silence is handled.

The harness was built as the Quality Playbook's test harness (replacing a ~10K-line Python subprocess harness, deleted 2026-06-11) but the core is payload-agnostic — the validated end-to-end runs orchestrated stub workers with zero QPB involvement. It ships two ways: a standalone repo + pip/npm packages (canonical upstream), and a vendored copy inside QPB with a lineage note.

**Empirical grounding (all 2026-06-11):** three Sonnet validation passes + one Haiku 4.5 pass (low-reasoning-model bet confirmed), multi-entry pool run with staggered dispatch, agent-honored STOP, detached workers surviving dispatch turns (pgrep-verified), and two observed in-the-wild silent loop-drops in a long-idle watcher session — which is exactly why the capability ladder and the printed-command floor exist.

## 2. Actors

- **Operator** — the human who writes the plan, starts the harness, and reads the results. May be on a locked-down corporate machine.
- **Orchestrator agent** — the AI session (Claude Code today; Copilot CLI candidate) that runs the tick loop at cadence rung 1. Optional below rung 1.
- **Ticker** — the foreground/`--once` Python script that replaces the orchestrator agent at cadence rungs 3-4 (and serves rung 2 as the cron target).
- **Worker** — the dispatched agent (subagent or detached host-CLI process) that does one job and reports via heartbeats.
- **Host scheduler** — ScheduleWakeup / `/every` / cron / launchd / Task Scheduler / host Automations, whichever exists.

## 3. User stories

1. As an operator, I want to run quality audits across several repos overnight from one pasted prompt, so multi-repo benchmarking doesn't need my attention between start and finish.
2. As an operator, I want to watch progress in a status table each tick, so I know what's running, queued, finished, or stalled without reading log files.
3. As an operator, I want to halt a run by dropping a STOP file, so I never have to interrupt or kill an agent mid-thought.
4. As an operator whose session crashed (or whose wakeup silently died), I want to resume by running one command against the existing run directory, so no work is lost and nothing double-runs.
5. As a developer on a locked-down Windows machine with no admin rights and no cron, I want to open PowerShell and run one Python script that drives the whole plan, so the worst-case environment is still fully supported.
6. As a Codex/Copilot/Cursor user, I want my workers dispatched through my own CLI, so the harness isn't Claude-only.
7. As a budget-conscious user, I want the orchestration to work on a small/cheap model, so I can spend the capable-model budget on the workers.
8. As a first-time adopter, I want `pip install` + one pasted prompt to show me a complete 3-job pool run in ~20 minutes with no API spend beyond my session, so I can evaluate the thesis in one sitting.
9. As a maintainer, I want every run to leave a complete disk record, so any run can be audited after the fact without chat scrollback.
10. As the article's reader, I want the README to tell me honestly which hosts/rungs are verified versus designed, so I can trust the claims.

## 4. Use cases (Applied Software Project Management format)

### UC-1: Run a multi-job plan natively (cadence 1 + dispatch 1)

**Summary:** The operator pastes the bootstrap prompt into a fresh agent session; the session drives the plan to completion autonomously.
**Rationale:** The headline workflow — zero infrastructure, one paste.
**Users:** Operator, orchestrator agent, workers.
**Preconditions:** Plan JSON exists and validates; the session's host has a scheduling primitive and a subagent tool; run-dir parent is on local disk.
**Basic course of events:**
1. Operator pastes the bootstrap (with the plan path) into a fresh session.
2. Agent probes its tooling, announces the selected rungs (cadence 1, dispatch 1), reads the harness SKILL by absolute path.
3. Agent runs `--init`; the tick engine scaffolds the run-dir and queues all entries.
4. Agent runs tick 1; the engine emits dispatch entries up to pool_size; agent launches each worker subagent with its prompt verbatim; workers return one-line acknowledgments and run detached.
5. Agent prints the status table verbatim and schedules the next tick.
6. On each wakeup the agent runs one tick; the engine reaps terminal heartbeats into results, back-fills free pool slots from the queue (staggered dispatch), and updates the table. Idle ticks still reschedule.
7. When all entries are terminal the engine reports `done`; the agent prints the final table and exits without rescheduling.
**Alternative paths:** (a) A wakeup silently fails to fire → operator's next message (or the printed ticker command) resumes the loop from disk (see UC-4). (b) A worker stalls past the threshold → engine marks STALLED; the table shows it; operator decides. (c) A dispatch fails auth → entry goes AUTH_OR_LAUNCH_FAILED, run continues.
**Postconditions:** Run-dir contains final `harness_status.json` (`done: true`), one result record and full heartbeat file per entry; session idle; no further wakeups.

### UC-2: Monitor a run in progress

**Summary:** The operator reads per-tick status tables (or the disk) to understand run state.
**Rationale:** Observability without log spelunking; the table is the UI.
**Users:** Operator.
**Preconditions:** A run is in flight.
**Basic course of events:**
1. Each tick prints the ASCII table: per-run state, phase, last heartbeat status and age; queue/claimed/running/stalled/completed/failed counts; next-tick time.
2. The operator reads it in the session (or any tier's stdout) — or inspects `harness_status.json` and heartbeat tails directly, since disk is truth.
**Alternative paths:** Operator asks the agent to "run another tick now" — safe by idempotency; only the cycle counter changes if nothing advanced.
**Postconditions:** None (read-only).

### UC-3: Halt a run early

**Summary:** The operator drops a STOP file; the next tick halts the loop cleanly.
**Rationale:** Deterministic, race-free shutdown that never interrupts the agent mid-action.
**Users:** Operator, orchestrator agent/ticker.
**Preconditions:** Run in flight; operator can write to the run-dir.
**Basic course of events:**
1. Operator creates `<run-dir>/STOP`.
2. The next tick observes it; the engine reports `stop: true` and mutates nothing (the stop tick is fully read-only — not even the cycle counter changes).
3. The agent/ticker prints the table, states STOP detected, and exits without rescheduling.
**Alternative paths:** STOP written after the final reap → run already `done`; STOP is inert. In-flight detached workers continue to their own terminal states (documented orphan semantics; no kill in this release).
**Postconditions:** Loop terminated; state untouched from the last completed tick; run resumable by deleting STOP and ticking.

### UC-4: Resume after a crash or silent loop-drop

**Summary:** Any fresh session — or the ticker — resumes an interrupted run from disk.
**Rationale:** Two silent wakeup-drops were observed in the wild on 2026-06-11; recovery must be one action.
**Users:** Operator, any fresh orchestrator agent or the ticker.
**Preconditions:** A run-dir with non-terminal state exists.
**Basic course of events:**
1. Operator notices the loop stopped (no new ticks).
2. Operator re-pastes the bootstrap in any session pointing at the existing RUN_DIR (skip `--init`) — or runs the printed `harness_ticker.py --once <run-dir>` command.
3. The tick engine reads disk and continues exactly where the run left off; idempotency guarantees nothing double-dispatches.
**Alternative paths:** Machine slept/hibernated → heartbeat ages are inflated; the wall-clock-jump guard treats ages as suspect for one tick instead of false-STALLING.
**Postconditions:** Loop running again; at most one cycle increment beyond the interruption point; zero duplicated work.

### UC-5: Run on a locked-down host (cadence 3 + dispatch 2 — the floor that must work)

**Summary:** On Windows/macOS/Linux with no admin rights and no scheduler access, the operator runs the plan from one terminal window with the foreground ticker.
**Rationale:** Operator-set worst case (2026-06-11): corporate locked-down Windows must be first-class.
**Users:** Operator, ticker, workers (detached host-CLI processes).
**Preconditions:** User-level Python 3; at least one agent CLI on PATH and authenticated; plan entries use `dispatch_mode: "shell"` with `worker_cmd` templates.
**Basic course of events:**
1. Operator opens cmd/PowerShell/terminal — no elevation.
2. Operator runs `python harness_ticker.py <plan-or-run-dir>`.
3. The ticker loops: run one tick; for each dispatch entry, write the worker prompt to a file and spawn the host CLI detached (platform-appropriate flags), recording PID + start time in the claim lock; print the table; sleep `tick_interval`; repeat.
4. On `done`, the ticker prints the final table and exits.
**Alternative paths:** (a) Operator closes the window → in-flight child workers may die (documented); rerunning the ticker resumes and re-detects state from heartbeats/PID locks. (b) CLI auth fails pre-flight → entry marked AUTH_OR_LAUNCH_FAILED with an actionable message. (c) No scheduler AND the operator can't keep a window open → UC-6 or UC-7.
**Postconditions:** Same disk record as UC-1 — the run artifacts are tier-invariant.

### UC-6: Scheduled run via cron or host automations (cadence 2 + dispatch 2)

**Summary:** An OS scheduler (or Codex-style Automations) fires one tick per cadence interval; no window stays open.
**Rationale:** Long/overnight plans on hosts where a scheduler is available; survives logouts.
**Users:** Operator, host scheduler, ticker (`--once`), workers.
**Preconditions:** Scheduler rights; plan uses shell dispatch; run-dir initialized.
**Basic course of events:**
1. Operator installs the printed one-line schedule entry (`harness_ticker.py --once <run-dir>` at the tick cadence).
2. Each fire executes exactly one tick (the per-run-dir lockfile makes overlapping fires skip cleanly).
3. Operator removes the schedule entry after `done` (or the entry self-reports done and exits instantly thereafter — idempotent and cheap).
**Alternative paths:** DST/local-time cron quirks documented; relative-interval rungs immune.
**Postconditions:** Same disk record; schedule entry removable at leisure.

### UC-7: Manual-tick floor (cadence 4)

**Summary:** With no scheduler, no ticker loop, and no agent session, the operator advances the run by hand, one printed command at a time.
**Rationale:** The harness must never strand a run: every failure path prints the exact next command.
**Users:** Operator.
**Preconditions:** A run-dir exists; user-level Python.
**Basic course of events:**
1. Any failure of a higher rung prints: "to continue this run, execute: `python3 <abs>/harness_ticker.py --once <run-dir>`".
2. The operator runs it whenever convenient; each invocation is one safe tick.
3. Repeat until the output reports done.
**Alternative paths:** Operator over-ticks — harmless (cycle-only diffs).
**Postconditions:** Same disk record; cadence is whatever the operator made it.

### UC-8: Install and run the demo (adopter first contact)

**Summary:** A new user installs from pip or npm and watches a complete 3-job pool run in ~20 minutes.
**Rationale:** The downloadable artifact is the article's proof; the demo IS the thesis experienced.
**Users:** Operator (first-time), orchestrator agent or ticker, Python stub workers.
**Preconditions:** User-level install (`pip install --user <name>` / `npm install <name>`); a Claude Code session OR just Python (the demo runs at any rung).
**Basic course of events:**
1. Operator installs the package and locates the example plan (Python stub workers — cross-platform, no API spend).
2. Operator pastes the bootstrap (rung 1) or runs the ticker (rung 3).
3. The demo exhibits: pool-limited dispatch, genuine idle ticks, staggered dispatch when the first stub finishes, heartbeat-driven reaps, clean self-termination — in ~20 minutes.
**Alternative paths:** Locked-down host → the demo works identically at rung 3 (that's the point).
**Postconditions:** The user has seen every architectural claim demonstrated on their own machine.

### UC-9: Run as an in-context worker (harness mode + in-context capability)

**Summary:** The operator bootstraps a session that does work itself, pulling tasks from a streaming instruction folder, while optionally also managing background workers — generalizing the QPB runner/watcher pattern into a first-class wakecycle mode.
**Rationale:** Unifies the bespoke runner pattern into the product; the natural home for the externalize-recognize-rehydrate discipline.
**Users:** Operator, orchestrator agent (acting as the worker), optional background workers.
**Preconditions:** A rung-1 session (the in-context work requires an agent); an instruction folder; optionally a background plan.
**Basic course of events:**
1. Operator bootstraps the session pointed at an instruction folder (and optionally a plan).
2. On each wake the agent does any new in-context instructions (writing outputs); then — when not mid-in-context-work — ticks the background harness; then schedules the next wake. While in-context work is in progress, monitoring pauses (FR-46).
3. On resume after a crash/compaction, the agent rehydrates from disk (FR-48) and continues.
4. `STOP` halts; an empty queue idles.
**Alternative paths:** (a) A Class-C agent-loop drop (C-5) stops the loop → the background workers are still rescuable by the deterministic floor (`ticker.py --once`), while the in-context queue waits for an operator re-bootstrap. (b) A single in-context task longer than ~4× the stall threshold looks like a slept machine to the engine → the orchestrator passes a "busy, not asleep" hint so a genuine stall isn't blurred (FR-8 / E2 interaction).
**Postconditions:** Instruction outputs written; background run-dir consistent; full disk record; resumable from disk alone.

### UC-10: Build and run a session conversationally (the headline UX)

**Summary:** The operator describes a batch in plain language to the agent that has the skill loaded; the agent assembles the run, previews it, launches it on confirmation, and saves it for rerun — all without the operator hand-writing a plan.
**Rationale:** The build-and-run experience is what makes the tool usable and testable as a real user journey (FR-52/53); it showcases the whole system (shorthand + wrap adapter + dispatch modes + pool + SUMMARY) and works in any host agent (FR-54).
**Users:** Operator, host agent (any agentic coding system).
**Preconditions:** A host agent with the skill loaded; Python 3 available.
**Basic course of events:**
1. Operator: "run three jobs from `ABC.md`, `DEF.md`, `GHI.md`, pool 2, subagents." The agent assembles a `jobs:` shorthand, inferring subagent dispatch and reading each file as a worker prompt (FR-52.1).
2. Agent previews the assembled plan + `--check` result; operator confirms (FR-52.2).
3. Agent launches; the status table streams; on `done` the SUMMARY capstone is written (FR-45).
4. Operator: "save that to `my_run.json`." The agent writes both the shorthand and the expanded canonical plan (FR-52.4).
5. Later: `run my_run.json` reruns it faithfully; `status`/`resume`/`summary` cover watch-and-continue (FR-53).
**Alternative paths:** (a) "run `abc.exe def.exe ghi.exe jkl.exe`, pool 3" → the agent infers shell dispatch and wraps each executable via the FR-40 wrap adapter. (b) An ambiguous request → the agent asks a clarifying question rather than guessing. (c) Mid-build refinement: "add a fourth job", "change pool to 3", "make job 2 shell" (FR-52.5).
**Postconditions:** A run launched (or an authored/saved plan); optionally `my_run.json` persisted (shorthand + expanded) for faithful rerun.

## 5. Functional requirements

**Plan & configuration**
- FR-1: A plan is a single JSON file: `tick_interval_minutes`, `pool_size`, `stall_threshold_minutes`, `launch_grace_minutes`, `entries[]`.
- FR-2: Each entry: `task_id` (UUID), `target_repo` (absolute), `dispatch_mode` (`"subagent"` | `"shell"`), and a `worker_prompt` (subagent) or `worker_cmd` template + prompt-file (shell). All schemas carry `schema_version`; consumers warn on mismatch.
- FR-3: Worker prompts/commands receive the absolute-path placeholder block (`{HEARTBEAT_PATH}`, `{TASK_ID}`, `{RUN_DIR}`, `{TARGET_REPO}`); nothing is ever derived from cwd.

**Tick engine (state machine)**
- FR-4: All state lives on disk in a per-run directory (`plan.json` snapshot, `harness_status.json`, `queue/`, `claimed/`, `results/`, per-entry `run-NN/` with `heartbeat.ndjson`). Disk is the single source of truth.
- FR-5: One tick = read disk → apply transitions (reap terminals → dispatch into free slots → stall checks → done/stop detection) → write state atomically (write-temp-rename) → emit `{dispatch_list, status_table, next_tick_minutes, done, stop}` as JSON on stdout.
- FR-6: Every transition is idempotent; a double tick changes only the `cycle` counter (the deliberate idle-tick witness — a true empty diff is impossible by design).
- FR-7: Pool semantics: at most `pool_size` non-terminal dispatched entries; freed slots are back-filled from the queue in the same tick (staggered dispatch).
- FR-8: Stall detection: heartbeat age > threshold ⇒ STALLED; `launch_grace_minutes` before first heartbeat; mandatory worker keepalives make the global threshold safe; a wall-clock jump (tick gap ≫ cadence) suppresses stall marking for one tick (E2).
- FR-9: The reap transition verifies the claimed job record; an externally-missing claim is recorded as an anomaly, never fabricated success.
- FR-10: A `STOP` file at the run-dir root makes the next tick fully read-only: report `stop: true`, change nothing (not even `cycle`).
- FR-11: When all entries are terminal the engine reports `done: true`; terminal ticks suppress the next-tick line in the table.
- FR-12: A per-run-dir lockfile serializes concurrent tick processes (`fcntl`/`msvcrt`); a locked tick skips with a message (E1).
- FR-13: `--init <plan>` scaffolds a new timestamped run-dir and queues all entries; re-running a tick against any existing run-dir resumes it.

**Dispatch**
- FR-14 (subagent mode): the orchestrator launches one subagent per dispatch entry, prompt verbatim, via its session's subagent tool (`Task`/`Agent` — prose names both); the worker's return contract is a single summary line; workers never echo heartbeat content.
- FR-15 (shell mode): the dispatching tier writes the prompt to a file and spawns the host CLI detached (POSIX `start_new_session`; Windows `DETACHED_PROCESS|CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`), recording PID + start time in the claim lock for dead-vs-slow stall discrimination (A-5).
- FR-16: A cheap per-CLI auth/availability pre-flight runs before first shell dispatch; failures mark the entry `AUTH_OR_LAUNCH_FAILED` with an actionable message rather than silently stalling.
- FR-17: The orchestrating tier dispatches exactly what `dispatch_list` names — never more, never on its own initiative.

*Dispatch (who does the work) and cadence (what triggers the next check, FR-23) are independent axes. Any dispatch mode pairs with any cadence rung; the capability ladder is their cross-product. The lone coupling: the in-context dispatch of FR-46 does its own tasks in the live agent, so those specific tasks ride on rung-1 cadence, while everything that mode also dispatches/watches can run at any rung.*

**Heartbeat contract**
- FR-18: Workers append single-line JSON records (`ts`, `task_id`, `schema_version`, `status` ∈ STARTING|IN_PROGRESS|COMPLETED|FAILED|ABANDONED, plus optional `label`, `message`, `data`) to their heartbeat file; terminal records carry `result_file` + `summary`. **`status` is the ONLY field the harness interprets** (it drives the state machine). `label` is a short free-form string displayed verbatim in the status table (column: ACTIVITY; truncated to width; ASCII-sanitized for display, raw preserved on disk) — this replaces the older `phase`/`step` pair. `message` is longer human-facing detail. `data` is an opaque JSON object the harness never reads — the structure escape hatch and the A2A migration path. (a vendored integration may set `label` from its own identity; that coupling never enters the generic core.)
- FR-19: A stdlib helper CLI performs all appends (`emit` / `keepalive` / `terminal`): JSON-encodes every value (no printf interpolation), opens with `O_APPEND`, one writer per run directory. The helper is optional — any conformant appender qualifies (Postel: the harness is liberal in what it accepts; malformed lines are skipped with a warning, never fatal).
- FR-20: **Specifiable heartbeat file.** By default the harness assigns `{HEARTBEAT_PATH}` inside the run-dir; a plan entry MAY instead declare `heartbeat_path` (absolute) to point the harness at a file the job already writes — supporting pre-existing tools/jobs with their own status-file location, with no change to the job. The run-dir result/manifest layout is unaffected.
- FR-21: If a heartbeat cannot be written, the helper exits nonzero loudly and worker guidance is to abort with FAILED (E6) — a silent worker must never look healthy.
- FR-21a: **No model-transcribed paths, ever.** Every harness-known path a worker needs (`{HEARTBEAT_PATH}`, `{TASK_ID}`, `{RUN_DIR}`, `{TARGET_REPO}`, and any helper/bin location e.g. `{HARNESS_BIN}`) is mechanically substituted by the tick engine before dispatch — a worker prompt must never ask a model to copy or substitute a literal path itself. Evidence: 2026-06-12 Haiku run `20260612T005833Z`, where the one hand-copied path in a stub script was transcribed as `/Users/anthropic/...` (username hallucinated), silently killing every heartbeat while the job "completed" invisibly — caught by launch grace, diagnosed only by script diff.
- FR-21b: When the engine marks an entry `AUTH_OR_LAUNCH_FAILED`, the status record and table carry a diagnostic hint ("no heartbeat received within launch grace — check worker-side launch: auth, helper availability, paths"), because the bucket covers more causes than auth. Long state names must not overflow the table column (fixed-width or abbreviated display).

**Cadence & degradation (the capability ladder)**
- FR-22: At startup an orchestrating agent probes its own tooling and announces the selected cadence + dispatch rungs.
- FR-23: Cadence rungs, preferred high to low: (1) in-session scheduling primitive; (2) OS/host scheduler firing `--once` ticks; (3) foreground ticker loop; (4) manual ticks. Rungs 2-4 require shell dispatch.
- FR-24: The ticker provides rungs 3-4: loop mode (tick → spawn → sleep) and `--once`; stdlib-only.
- FR-25: Every scheduling-failure path — at every rung — prints the exact next command (absolute paths filled in) to continue the run in another window. No run is ever stranded without printed instructions.
- FR-26: Loop-continuation discipline: every non-terminal tick ends with a reschedule (or its rung's equivalent); idle is not done; the only clean exits are `done` and `stop`.
- FR-26a: **Safety tick (recommended deployment pattern, documented in README + STATE_MACHINE.md).** Because ticks are idempotent and the E1 lockfile serializes concurrent tick processes, redundant ticking is safe by construction — so a rung-1 (in-session timer) run SHOULD be paired with a low-frequency external safety tick (cron/scheduler/second-terminal ticker running `--once` at ~3× the plan cadence) against the same run-dir. While the in-session timer is alive, safety ticks are cycle-only no-ops; if the timer dies silently, the safety tick rescues the run within one safety interval with no detection logic and no operator nudge. Rationale: in-session scheduled tasks are session-scoped and empirically fragile in long sessions (4+ silent drops observed in the v1.5.9 runner watcher, 2026-06-11/12; ScheduleWakeup subsystem has known rough edges upstream); the harness treats rung-1 timers as fallible rather than trusting them.

**Observability & evidence**
- FR-27: The status table is pure ASCII, printed verbatim by the relaying tier, and shows per-run state/phase/last-heartbeat/age plus aggregate counts.
- FR-28: A completed run's directory is a self-sufficient audit record: final status, every heartbeat line, every result record, the plan snapshot.
- FR-29: Pre-flight warns when the run-dir path looks like a synced folder (OneDrive/Dropbox patterns) (E4).

**Distribution**
- FR-30: Shipped as a standalone repo (canonical upstream) + pip and npm packages installable user-level; a downstream consumer may carry a vendored copy with a lineage note and a drift test pinned to an upstream release.
- FR-31: The package includes the example plan with cross-platform Python stub workers — the ~20-minute zero-API-spend demo (UC-8) — runnable at rung 1 or rung 3.
- FR-32: The plugin layout (plugin.json + marketplace.json) qualifies for Claude-marketplace submission; the harness plugin is submitted.
- FR-33: Publishes are gated: clean-clone cold-build, built-artifact end-to-end test in a throwaway environment, dry-run before any live upload (the publish-safety discipline verbatim).

### v0.1.0 first-release UX additions

*Scope locked 2026-06-13. These extend the founding contract for the first functional release (v0.1.0); none of them change the disk-truth state machine or the single-`status` worker contract. Numbering continues the stable reference. Build status: all PENDING (see §9) — this section defines the target, not the delivered state; no README or marketing claim derives from an FR until its §9 row is non-PENDING.*

**Scope decisions (2026-06-13).** The operator chose the full scope on all four open decisions, to be delivered in small, individually-tested increments (no deadline pressure; correctness over speed):
1. **In-context mode: in.** But the design separates the two things it was conflating — *dispatch-to-self* (a third dispatch mode, FR-46) and *cadence/wake-up style* (the existing rungs, FR-23). Motivation is dogfooding: Wakecycle runs continuously to orchestrate its own and QPB's development, which generates an always-on workload to exercise every cadence rung (own polling vs OS timer vs terminal-window ticker). Explicitly NOT a fix for the Class-C agent-loop drop (C-5/C-7); the dogfooding measures which wake-up modes survive real use.
2. **All five control commands: in** (PAUSE/RESUME, CADENCE, POOL, POLL-NOW, CANCEL), built in increments.
5. **Testing approach.** The release ships a deterministic integration-test suite, and Wakecycle dogfoods as its own test-run orchestrator (FR-51). FR-51 is the *foundational first increment* — the regression net is built and pinned to current behavior before any FR-35..50 feature lands — not a sub-item of the control commands. Dogfooding *measures* which wake-up modes survive real use; it never *validates* a §9 evidence row (those require a recorded matrix run, NFR-12).
3. **Both input adapters: in** (wrap + tail), with a one-field selector (FR-40/41).
4. **Full job-config UX: in** (`--check`, shorthand, examples, TOOLKIT builder, FR-42..44); maintaining two config formats is acceptable.

**Versioning**
- FR-34: **Single canonical version + startup banner.** Wakecycle carries one version string in one place (`wakecycle/__init__.py:__version__`, mirrored to `pyproject.toml` and `package.json`, drift-tested). Every surface reads it: the orchestrator's startup announce line, `tick.py --init`, the ticker startup, and the skill banner. A startup banner prints `wakecycle <version>` so the running version is always visible. Fixes the inconsistency carried in from extraction (the SKILL frontmatter `version: 1.5.9` was QPB's, while `pyproject` is `0.0.1`).

**Live control surface (the control-file convention)**
- FR-35: **Control-file convention.** Generalizing `STOP` (FR-10): the engine reads a fixed, closed set of named control files at the run-dir root — `STOP`, `PAUSE`, `RESUME`, `CADENCE`, `POOL`, `POLL-NOW`, `CANCEL` — at the top of each tick and applies them deterministically before transitions. **Reads and consumption happen inside the not-stopped path, so `STOP` keeps its fully-read-only tick (FR-10): if `STOP` is present it wins and nothing else is read or consumed.** When several controls coexist they apply in a fixed precedence — `STOP` > `CANCEL` > `PAUSE`/`RESUME` > `CADENCE`/`POOL` > `POLL-NOW` — which is the canonical evaluation order. Controls are one of two kinds: **one-shot** (`POLL-NOW`, `CANCEL`) are consumed (deleted) after they fire once; **sticky** (`PAUSE`/`RESUME`, `CADENCE`, `POOL`) set a persisted override in `harness_status.json` and govern subsequent ticks until changed (the file is consumed once its value is persisted). Control files work at every rung (agent, ticker, cron, manual), survive session restarts, and need no JSON editing. Unknown control files — and known control files carrying an unparseable or out-of-range value — are ignored with a warning row and never wedge the machine (Postel); consumption uses the engine's atomic write-temp-rename discipline so a STOP tick that finds a stray control still mutates nothing.
- FR-36: **PAUSE / RESUME.** A `PAUSE` file makes the orchestrator stop scheduling new ticks WITHOUT declaring the run `done` or `stop` (distinct from `STOP`, which halts terminally). In-flight workers keep running. Removing `PAUSE` (or dropping `RESUME`) resumes normal scheduling on the next tick. The status table shows a PAUSED banner while paused. When in-context mode is active (FR-46), `PAUSE` is observed at the next tick boundary — i.e. after the current in-context task finishes, since the turn is single-threaded (C-6) — and it suspends both background ticking and pulling the next instruction from the streaming queue (FR-47).
- FR-37: **Live cadence (and pool) override.** A `CADENCE <minutes>` control sets a persisted `tick_interval_minutes` override (sticky, per FR-35) that governs subsequent ticks without editing `plan.json`; a non-positive or unparseable value is rejected with a warning and the prior cadence retained (Postel). This reconciles the existing live-config asymmetry (today `tick_interval`/`stall`/`grace`/`idle_mult` are re-read from `plan.json` each tick while `pool_size` is sticky from `--init`): a `POOL <n>` control gives `pool_size` the same explicit runtime path. The two are not symmetric in mechanism — the cadence override layers over the per-tick plan re-read, while the pool override must write back to the sticky `harness_status.json` `pool_size`. Raising the pool back-fills dispatch on the next tick; lowering it below the current in-flight count is honored as slots drain and never kills a running worker.
- FR-38: **POLL-NOW.** A `POLL-NOW` control file forces exactly one immediate tick at the next opportunity — the unattended, file-based equivalent of the operator's "run another tick now"; consumed after one tick. `POLL-NOW` does not pierce `PAUSE` — while paused it is inert and waits for `RESUME` (per the FR-35 precedence).
- FR-39: **CANCEL.** A `CANCEL <run-NN>` control (run id in the file body or name suffix) marks a named run `abandoned` (terminal) AND writes a synthesized `abandoned` results record via the existing failure-synthesis path, so the run stays auditable in `results/` and in the SUMMARY (FR-45) rather than vanishing from the audit trail — freeing its pool slot, a deliberate operator out for the otherwise non-killable `stalled` state. `CANCEL` of an already-terminal or unknown run is a consumed no-op with a warning (it never un-terminals a completed run); an unparseable run id is ignored (Postel). (§8 keeps killing an in-flight worker out of scope; CANCEL frees the slot and stops watching the run; an orphaned worker, if any, runs to its own terminal — so the true running-process count may briefly exceed `pool_size` by design.)

**Flexible input (adapter at the edge — the engine contract is unchanged)**
- FR-40: **Wrap-and-run adapter (stdout capture).** A stdlib `heartbeat.py wrap` subcommand (the single worker-facing helper stays the adapter's home) launches an arbitrary command **as its own child**, redirecting the command's stdout+stderr to a file the adapter owns and tails. It emits `STARTING` immediately at launch, then `IN_PROGRESS` carrying the command's most recent output line as the ACTIVITY `label` — at least once within `launch_grace_minutes` and thereafter at ≤ ⅓ of `stall_threshold_minutes`, so a long-running quiet command never false-trips LAUNCH-FAIL or STALLED — and emits the terminal `COMPLETED`/`FAILED` directly from the command's exit code. Any command becomes a conformant wakecycle job with no change to the command itself. Because the adapter is the command's parent (not a third party watching a detached process), the capture is robust; the one caveat is display granularity — a command that block-buffers when its stdout is not a TTY may surface lines chunkily. Line-buffering is POSIX-best-effort only (a pty where available; `stdbuf` is absent on macOS/Windows and `pty` is POSIX-only), so on Windows output surfaces chunkily by design — a display-quality issue, never a correctness one, because **doneness comes from the exit code, never from parsing output.** v0.1.0 scope.
- FR-41: **Tail-existing-log adapter.** The adapter watches a log file a job already writes (pairing with FR-20's specifiable `heartbeat_path`), surfaces the most recent line as the ACTIVITY `label` in IN_PROGRESS heartbeats, and detects doneness via an operator-configured signal — a terminal-marker regex, a sentinel file the job touches, or process exit. This lets the harness monitor a job that emits *any* log format (not JSONL) while keeping the engine's single-`status` contract intact: **the adapter, not the engine, decides doneness** — the engine never guesses a terminal from arbitrary text. Process exit is the authoritative, always-available doneness signal; an operator-configured regex/sentinel is an optional overlay for jobs that signal completion only in their log — a success-marker maps to `COMPLETED`, an optional failure-marker to `FAILED`, default `COMPLETED` on a clean exit. The adapter records its supervised child PID in the run's claim lock so the engine's existing dead-PID reap backstops a sentinel that never arrives. FR-40 (wrap a command you launch) and FR-41 (tail a log a job already writes) are the two adapter modes; both are v0.1.0 scope. Use wrap when wakecycle owns the launch, tail when something else does. **A single plan field — `adapter: "wrap" | "tail"` (with the wrapped command or the tailed log path) — selects the mode, so the operator declares intent in one place and never wires the plumbing by hand.**

**Job-configuration UX**
- FR-42: **Plan pre-flight (`tick.py --check <plan>`).** Validate a plan before launch: schema conformance, presence of the required placeholders in each `worker_prompt`, existence of each `target_repo`, and (optionally) run each entry's `auth_check`. Report all problems at once. Schema conformance is a hand-rolled stdlib check against the plan schema's required keys (NFR-3 forbids a `jsonschema` dependency) and reuses the engine's placeholder set so the check can't drift from what dispatch actually substitutes. Catches config errors proactively instead of as a reactive `AUTH_OR_LAUNCH_FAILED` after launch spend.
- FR-43: **Simplified job shorthand + examples.** A higher-level `jobs:` plan form (e.g. `{repo, agent, prompt}` per job) that the skill/TOOLKIT expands into the full placeholder-laden plan, plus an `examples/` directory of ready-to-edit plan templates for the common cases (multi-repo agent review; shell jobs; mixed). The low-level plan schema stays canonical; the shorthand is a convenience layer.
- FR-44: **TOOLKIT as plan-builder.** `TOOLKIT.md` is the primary human-facing surface for creating configurations: the operator describes the batch in natural language and the agent writes a conformant `plan.json` (placeholders and defaults handled by the agent) per TOOLKIT's documented procedure.

**Result roll-up**
- FR-45: **SUMMARY artifact.** On the *transition into* `done` (guarded so a post-`done` idempotent re-tick stays cycle-only, FR-6), the engine writes both `SUMMARY.md` (human) and `summary.json` (machine, carrying `schema_version` per FR-2) to the run-dir: per-job terminal status, `result_file` pointers, durations, and the aggregate counts — a self-contained "what happened" capstone beyond the per-job `results/result-NNNNN.json` records.

**In-context worker mode (harness mode + in-context capability)**
- FR-46: **In-context capability (dispatch-to-self — a third dispatch mode, orthogonal to cadence).** Wakecycle separates two independent axes: *who does the work* (dispatch) and *what triggers the next check* (cadence, FR-23). In-context adds a third dispatch option alongside subagent (FR-14) and shell (FR-15): the orchestrator MAY do a task itself, in its own context, between ticks. It composes with any cadence rung for the dispatched/background portion of a run; the single cross-axis coupling is that the in-context *tasks themselves* need a live agent, so they ride on the agent's own scheduling (rung 1), while background workers the same run also watches can be driven by any rung. Harness mode (dispatch + monitor) is the base; in-context is a superset that retains every harness feature. Governing constraint: the agent turn is single-threaded, so in-context work and a harness tick are sequential, never simultaneous — while in-context work is in progress the agent cannot tick, so heartbeat reads, stall detection, dispatch, and status updates **pause** and resume between in-context tasks. Background processes/subagents keep running and heartbeating throughout; the next tick absorbs whatever changed (the engine already tolerates irregular ticks — FR-8's wall-clock-jump handling is the same property). In-context work takes attention-priority over the next tick; it does NOT preempt running background processes. An in-context session may freely spin off its own subagents/processes for sub-work (no capability limits); only concurrent monitoring is what pauses. In-context mode is enabled at bootstrap by an `instruction_folder` setting (a plan/bootstrap field); its presence selects the superset mode. **Limitation (C-7):** in-context mode does not fix Class-C loop drops and is rung-1 only — the deterministic floor (ticker/cron) rescues only the background/harness portion, never the in-context tasks, which require operator re-bootstrap (§8). It is a convenience/unification superset, not an unattended-reliability path (FR-50).
- FR-47: **Streaming instruction queue.** An in-context worker watches an instruction folder for tasks that arrive over time — a streaming queue, distinct from the plan's fixed batch (entries frozen at `--init`). Instructions are files named with a zero-padded numeric prefix (`NNN-...`); an instruction is "processed" when an output file carrying the same `NNN` stem exists in the outputs folder. It processes the lowest-numbered instruction with no matching output, writes that output, and idles when the queue is empty; a `STOP` file halts it (FR-10). This is the live-job-submission surface; the QPB runner is the degenerate case — instruction folder, no background plan.
- FR-48: **ERR discipline mandatory in-context.** Because in-context work fills the agent's context and is compaction-prone (unlike bounded-context harness mode, NFR-5), the in-context loop MUST externalize progress, recognize loss on resume, and rehydrate from disk (the externalize-recognize-rehydrate pattern). Wakecycle's disk state is the ERR substrate: on resume the agent re-reads `harness_status.json`, the instruction folder, and the outputs to re-establish exact state without trusting memory.
- FR-49: **Monitoring-pause visibility.** When the agent resumes ticking after an in-context burst, the status table notes the gap (e.g. "monitoring paused HH:MM–HH:MM for in-context work; N background changes since last poll") so the sparse cadence reads as intentional, not as a dropped loop.

**Testing**
- FR-51: **Deterministic integration-test suite (Wakecycle dogfoods itself).** The release ships an integration-test suite as a folder of scenarios — each a small plan plus stub workers plus an expected end-state — under `tests/integration/` (or equivalent). Two disciplines keep it trustworthy: (a) scenarios are driven by the deterministic ticker (`ticker.py --once` in a loop), never the agent loop, so a run is reproducible and CI-able and the flaky Class-C path never enters the regression net; (b) the pass/fail verdict is an **independent** plain-Python check that reads the disk artifacts (`harness_status.json`, `results/`, heartbeat files) and asserts — the harness never grades its own homework. Because a scenario IS a wakecycle job, the same suite doubles as a worked example of Wakecycle orchestrating a batch (the dogfood). The suite is built first (before the FR-35..50 features) and pinned to current behavior, so every later increment runs against a standing regression net. This complements, not replaces, the deterministic-core unit tests (red/green where the logic is a pure function of disk state — which is most of it; the thin agent layer gets integration + dogfood coverage instead).

**Positioning**
- FR-50: **Unattended-reliability guidance.** README/TOOLKIT steer operators who need reliable *unattended* runs toward the deterministic ticker/cron rungs (immune to the Class-C agent-loop drop, C-5), framing the in-session agent rung as the interactive/convenient mode backed by the FR-26a safety tick. The agent rung is not presented as the unattended-reliability path.
- FR-54: **Cross-agent universality is the identity — lead with it, keep it honest.** The product orchestrates ANY agentic coding system — Claude Code, Copilot, Codex, Cursor, Antigravity, … — not one vendor. This is delivered by construction: stdlib-only Python (runs wherever Python 3 does), the vendor-neutral contract *a job is anything that appends JSON lines to a file*, and host-CLI/subagent dispatch (FR-14/15). Messaging (README/TOOLKIT/SKILL) leads with this, not with any single host. **Honesty split (load-bearing):** the deterministic engine and the ticker/cron floor are genuinely host-agnostic and run identically everywhere; the *in-session agent rung* is where host differences live (Class-C is a Claude Code quirk; other hosts have their own scheduling quirks), so the universal-*reliability* claim rests on the floor, with the per-host agent rung as the convenience on top. The README support table marks each host VERIFIED (evidence-linked — e.g. Copilot + Codex, macOS, rung 3, from V-14) vs DESIGNED (NFR-12); "runs on any agentic system" describes the engine + floor, never an unvalidated per-host agent-rung claim.

### v0.1.0 interactive UX (the build-and-run experience)

*Added 2026-06-13 after the build was feature-complete: the interactive session builder is what makes the tool usable and testable as a real user journey, and the cross-agent identity (FR-54) is its backbone. Numbering continues the stable reference; build status PENDING (see §9).*

- FR-52: **Interactive session builder (host-agent-driven; the tool stays LLM-free).** The headline UX: an operator describes a run in plain language to whatever agent has the skill loaded — "run three jobs from `ABC.md`, `DEF.md`, `GHI.md`, pool 2, subagents"; "run `abc.exe def.exe ghi.exe jkl.exe`, pool 3" — and a session is assembled, previewed, run, and optionally saved. **Architecture (load-bearing for FR-54):** the tool embeds NO model — the HOST agent does the natural-language understanding and drives the procedure documented in the SKILL/TOOLKIT; the tool provides only deterministic plumbing (expand the `jobs:` shorthand FR-43 → `--check` FR-42 → write the plan → run). The builder is *designed* to be driven by any capable host agent — but it runs in the host's natural-language layer, i.e. on the per-host **agent rung**, NOT the universal engine/floor (FR-54). So "any host agent" is DESIGNED; it is VERIFIED only on the host(s) that have actually driven it end-to-end (Claude Code today) per NFR-12 — V-14 verified Copilot/Codex as detached *workers*, not as builder-driving orchestrators. The procedure:
  1. **Describe → assemble.** The agent builds a `jobs:` shorthand, **inferring dispatch per job by *intent*, not file extension**, on this precedence: (i) an explicit operator override wins; (ii) anything readable as agent instructions (a `.md`/`.txt`/`.prompt` file, or an inline instruction) ⇒ **subagent** mode, with the file's content read into the worker prompt; (iii) anything resolving to a runnable command — with or without args — ⇒ **shell** mode, the full command-with-args wrapped via the FR-40 wrap adapter (`adapter: "wrap"`); (iv) otherwise **ask** a clarifying question, never guess. One `jobs:` list MAY mix subagent and shell entries. (Reading a file into a prompt and choosing the mode are host-agent behaviors — the tool stays model-free; a resolved-vs-ask disambiguation table lives in TOOLKIT/SKILL.)
  2. **Preview → confirm.** Show the assembled plan and the `--check` result, **echoing the inferred dispatch mode and prompt source per job** ("job 2: SHELL, wrapping `build.sh`") so a mis-inference is caught BEFORE spend, then wait for one explicit "go" — it spends real agent budget, so "just works" means low friction, not zero safety. If `--check` fails, no "go" is offered: the errors surface for editing (step 5). A confirmation is valid only for the exact previewed plan.
  3. **Run.**
  4. **Persist on request.** "Save that to `my_run.json`" writes ONE file carrying both a `jobs:` key (the human-editable shorthand source) and a `plan:` key (the expanded canonical entries — the reproducible lockfile). `run my_run.json` executes the `plan:` (lockfile semantics); on load the tool **re-expands `jobs:` and warns — does not block — if the result differs from the saved `plan:`** (a hand-edit-drift signal), offering to re-expand or run the lockfile as-is. (Writing the expanded plan to a path is a small new affordance — `expand --out <path>` — since the expander today only prints to stdout; the save path is absolute, never cwd-derived (FR-21a), and overwriting an existing file is confirmed.)
  5. **Incremental editing.** Before launch — including when re-opening a saved-but-not-running plan — the conversation refines the run: "add a fourth job", "change pool to 3", "make job 2 shell". **Any edit returns the session to the unconfirmed state** (re-preview + re-`--check` + a fresh "go"). Editing a *live* run is out of scope here — that is the streaming-instruction-queue path (FR-47).

  **Scope:** the builder AUTHORS-AND-LAUNCHES a fixed batch; dropping new jobs into a *live* run is the streaming-instruction-queue path (FR-47), not the builder.
- FR-53: **First-class lifecycle verbs.** A coherent CLI vocabulary for the whole run lifecycle, so "start it, watch it, stop it, rerun it" is one obvious surface — and the backbone of an end-to-end integration test of the real user journey: `new` (interactive build, FR-52), `run <plan>` (launch an authored/saved plan), `status <run-dir>` (re-attach: read disk and print the current status table, read-only), `stop <run-dir>` (drop the `STOP` control file, FR-10, to halt cleanly), `resume <run-dir>` (continue an interrupted run; by default runs the ticker loop at rung 3 against the existing run-dir — the named front-end for the FR-13 resume — with `--once` as the single-tick form; idempotent), `summary <run-dir>` (print the SUMMARY capstone, FR-45; on a not-yet-done run it prints a "not done yet" notice rather than erroring). All are thin deterministic wrappers over existing capabilities (read disk, format the table, write a control file, tick, read SUMMARY) — no new engine state. Finer live control (pause/cadence/pool/cancel) stays the control-file convention (FR-35..39), not separate verbs. (The command name follows the final product name.)

## 6. Nonfunctional requirements

- NFR-1 **Cross-platform:** Windows, macOS, Linux — equal support; no platform-conditional features in the core.
- NFR-2 **No privileges:** no admin/root anywhere — install, run, schedule (rung 3 exists precisely for the no-scheduler case).
- NFR-3 **Zero runtime dependencies:** tick engine, ticker, and heartbeat helper are Python stdlib only. The only external requirements are user-level Python 3 and (for agent workers) a host CLI.
- NFR-4 **Model-tier tolerance:** orchestration must work on low-reasoning models — all decisions live in the deterministic script; the agent's per-tick role is ~7 fixed steps. Evidence: Haiku 4.5 clean loop (2026-06-11); prose carries absolute paths and dual tool-names because small models will not search or infer.
- NFR-5 **Bounded context:** per-tick agent prose is small and fixed; worker returns are one line; the orchestrator's context grows O(ticks), not O(work). No long-lived in-context state.
- NFR-6 **Determinism & idempotency:** same disk state ⇒ same tick outcome; re-entry is always safe (the property every rung of the ladder leans on).
- NFR-7 **Encoding safety:** all text I/O is `encoding="utf-8", errors="replace"` for external content; console output is ASCII-safe (cp1252 hazard); enforced by AST sweep tests with mutation-verified pins.
- NFR-8 **Reliability through degradation, honestly stated:** wakeup primitives are known to drop silently (observed twice, 2026-06-11); the design treats every rung as fallible and makes recovery one printed command. Docs state the window-stays-open and orphan-on-STOP semantics plainly.
- NFR-9 **Auditability:** any run reconstructable from its run-dir alone — no chat scrollback required.
- NFR-10 **Run-dirs on local disk** (synced/network folders unsupported, warned).
- NFR-11 **Security posture:** no network calls of its own, no telemetry, no shell-out except the operator-declared `worker_cmd` templates; prompt-files avoid shell-quoting injection surfaces; Apache-2.0.
- NFR-12 **Honest host-support claims:** the README's support table distinguishes VERIFIED (evidence-linked) from DESIGNED (unverified) per host/rung. No claim ships without a validation-matrix run behind it. As of v0.1.0 the locked-down floor (cadence 2/3/4 + shell dispatch + Windows) is DESIGNED, not yet VERIFIED (§9) — it must not be claimed as working until its validation matrix is green.
- NFR-13 **Tick cost:** a tick is sub-second script execution; idle ticks are cheap by design so over-polling is always safe.

## 7. Constraints & assumptions

- C-1: One writer per heartbeat file (per run-NN/) — concurrency safety derives from layout, not locking.
- C-2: In-session subagents do not survive their session's turn ending in externally-ticked contexts — hence the cadence/dispatch coupling rule.
- C-3: The orchestrator session (rung 1) or ticker window (rung 3) must stay open for the plan's duration; rung 2 has no such constraint.
- C-4: Workers must be able to run the heartbeat helper (user-level Python 3 on their host).
- C-5: In-session autonomous loops have a host-side fragility that is NOT the timer: per the 2026-06-12 Class-C forensics, wakeups fired 4/4 reliably, but the wakeup-resumed model turn intermittently mis-serializes its first tool call into the text channel and dies silently on `end_turn`. Compaction/E7 was refuted as a cause (0/4). Treat every rung-1 resumed turn as fallible; the FR-26a safety tick is the standing mitigation, independent of root cause.
- C-6: In-context mode (FR-46) and harness ticks time-share a single agent turn — sequential, never concurrent — so monitoring is coarse-grained during in-context bursts by construction. Background workers + subagents + in-context work coexist in one session (the superset); doing in-context work *concurrently* with monitoring is not possible and not needed.
- C-7: In-context mode (FR-46) is rung-1 only — the in-context work requires an agent. The deterministic floor (ticker/cron) can rescue only the harness/background portion of an in-context session, never the in-context tasks themselves (C-5 applies to those).

## 8. Out of scope (this release)

Kill semantics for in-flight workers on STOP (documented orphan behavior — though FR-39 `CANCEL` now frees a stalled run's slot); per-phase stall thresholds; A2A/cross-machine transport (schemas are A2A-ready by carrying `task_id`/`schema_version`); full Codex/Cursor per-host validation matrices (v0.2); harness resume/iterate strategies (deferred); the silent-drop watchdog (`--max-quiet`) beyond the printed-command recovery; orchestrator-side telemetry/dashboards (the table and the disk are the UI); **automatic recovery of the in-context queue from a Class-C drop** (C-7 — no clean auto-relaunch of a fresh agent session exists; recovery stays operator-re-bootstrap).
