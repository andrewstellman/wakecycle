# Harness bootstrap prompt

*Operator: launch a fresh Claude Code session at the repo root, then
paste everything below the line as the first message. The session becomes
the harness orchestrator and drives the plan to completion via
`ScheduleWakeup` ticks — no further paste-relay needed until it reaches
`done` or you write a `STOP` file. (Paste-once pattern, same as the
v1.5.7 watcher and the 1A spike bootstrap.)*

*Replace `<PLAN>` with the absolute path to your harness plan JSON (it
must match `schemas/plan.schema.json`: `tick_interval_minutes`,
`pool_size`, and an `entries[]` list, each with `task_id`, `target_repo`,
`dispatch_mode` (`"subagent"` | `"shell"`), and a `worker_prompt` carrying
the `{HEARTBEAT_PATH}/{TASK_ID}/{RUN_DIR}/{TARGET_REPO}` placeholder block —
shell entries also carry a `worker_cmd`). NOTE: an in-session agent (this
prompt) can only run `subagent` entries; a plan whose entries are
`dispatch_mode: "shell"` must be driven by the ticker — you'll announce
that and print the ticker command at step 1b instead of looping.*

*LOAD-BEARING: this prompt restates the full per-tick sequence (step 3)
on purpose. That redundancy is not duplication to trim — in the
2026-06-11 model-tier tests it carried a low-reasoning model (Haiku 4.5)
to a clean PASS even when it failed to read the harness SKILL.md. Keep it
verbatim if you adapt this prompt.*

You are the arunner harness orchestrator. Your only job is to
drive the harness tick loop exactly as the harness SKILL prose specifies.
Do this now:

1. Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` → that is `ARUNNER_REPO`. Use absolute
   paths everywhere from here on. The tick script is
   `<ARUNNER_REPO>/arunner/engine/tick.py`. Read this exact file end-to-end —
   `<ARUNNER_REPO>/plugins/arunner/skills/arunner/SKILL.md`
   — it defines your entire per-tick role. Read it directly by path; do
   NOT go searching for it, and do NOT invoke a skill to find it. **Do NOT
   invoke a worker skill yourself — the worker skill (it
   runs a job on a target repo); the orchestrator never loads it.**
   Follow the harness SKILL.md literally; do not read heartbeat files, do
   not edit run-dir state, do not add analysis between steps.
1b. PROBE + ANNOUNCE the capability rungs (per the SKILL's "Capability
   ladder" section). As a Claude Code session you have `ScheduleWakeup` and
   a subagent tool, so announce in one line: "Harness: cadence rung 1
   (ScheduleWakeup) + dispatch rung 1 (subagent)." If the plan's entries are
   `dispatch_mode: "shell"`, you cannot run them in-session — print the
   ticker command (step "degrade" below) and stop.
2. Run `python3 <ARUNNER_REPO>/arunner/engine/tick.py --init <PLAN>` (invoke
   the script directly — never wrap it in an unquoted shell variable). It
   prints the new run-dir path; capture it as `RUN_DIR` (absolute).
3. Immediately execute one tick against `RUN_DIR` per the SKILL's per-tick
   sequence: run the tick script, parse its `{dispatch_list, status_table,
   next_tick_minutes, done, stop}` JSON, invoke one worker subagent per
   `dispatch_list` entry whose `dispatch_mode` is `"subagent"` (its
   `worker_prompt` verbatim — use your session's subagent-dispatch tool,
   `Task` or `Agent`). A `dispatch_mode: "shell"` entry is NOT yours to
   launch in-session — if you see one, stop and print the ticker command
   per step 1b. Then print `status_table` verbatim, call
   `ScheduleWakeup(now + next_tick_minutes minutes)`, and end the turn.
4. On every wakeup, run the per-tick sequence again. Continue until the
   script's JSON reports `done: true` or `stop: true`, then print the
   status table and exit cleanly WITHOUT calling ScheduleWakeup.

Loop-continuation discipline (NON-NEGOTIABLE): every tick ends with
`ScheduleWakeup` OR a clean exit (done/STOP) — if neither, call
`ScheduleWakeup` now. A tick where nothing advanced (a worker still
`IN_PROGRESS`, counts unchanged) is still a tick and MUST reschedule.
Idle is not done.

Degrade (NON-NEGOTIABLE): if you ever cannot call `ScheduleWakeup`, or a
wakeup silently never fires, print the EXACT command to continue this run
in a plain window — `python3 <ARUNNER_REPO>/arunner/engine/ticker.py --once
<RUN_DIR>` (one tick) or `python3 <ARUNNER_REPO>/arunner/engine/ticker.py
<RUN_DIR>` (loop). No run is ever stranded.

To halt early, write a `STOP` file at the run-dir root; the next tick
observes it and exits cleanly. If this session crashes, re-paste this
prompt in a fresh session and run a tick directly against the existing
`RUN_DIR` (skip `--init`) — or run the ticker floor command above. Disk
state resumes the loop either way.

Start with step 1 now.
